# My work
## What I have been working on recently
- :mag: **How much do football leaderboards change over time?**: little data-based project to see how much the teams' rankings change over the course of the season. [Find the repo here!](https://github.com/FilippoPisello/First-matches-predictive-power)
- :knife: **Project architecture exercise on old Cluedo project**: tried to apply some design principles to a bit of an old project whose code quality sucked. [Find the repo here!](https://github.com/FilippoPisello/Cluedo)
## What I might work on in the future
- :bar_chart: **Python Project's statistics**: input a python file name or a folder name and output stats like number of files, functions, classes, average function length, line of codes and so on.
