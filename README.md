# My work

## Published Python packages

I have published a couple of Python packages mainly for the sake of learning how to do it. As you might have guessed, they did not exactly become trending. Here they are:

- :ok_hand: **EasyPred**: easily store, investigate, assess and compare the predictions obtained through your Machine Learning models. [Find the repo here!](https://github.com/FilippoPisello/EasyPred)
- :world_map: **SpreadPandas**: get the dimensional mapping of a pandas data frame to a spreadsheet. [Find the repo here!](https://github.com/FilippoPisello/SpreadPandas)

## What I tend to work on

This file tends to get old quite quickly, so make sure to actually check my commits if you want to know the truth.

Anyway, generally I code a lot for work, generally with the goal of automating repetitive actions:

- **ETL processes from/to Salesforce**: I work in the commercial domain in Picnic technologies, and most of the stuff that concerns me happens in Salesforce. I have been developing a lot of chrono jobs that perform systematic changes/warning/reporting from and to Salesforce.
- **Slack warnings/logging**: still connected to the above, various workflows that inform users of anomalies and/or changes made.
- **Moving data from X to Y**: refresh that report, import that file, populate that table in the database. All stuff that often needs to run on a periodic basis.

## What I might work on in the future

- :houses: **My Properties Manager**: webapp to keep an eye on rented properties, just for the sake of getting my hands dirty with web app designing.
