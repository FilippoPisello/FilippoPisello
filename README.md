# My work
## Published packages
- :ok_hand: **EasyPred**: easily store, investigate, assess and compare the predictions obtained through your Machine Learning models. [Find the repo here!](https://github.com/FilippoPisello/EasyPred)
- :world_map: **SpreadPandas**: get the dimensional mapping of a pandas data frame to a spreadsheet. [Find the repo here!](https://github.com/FilippoPisello/SpreadPandas)

## What I have been working on recently
- :books: **Read books tracker**: my first approach both to GUIs and databases. An interface-Model-Database system that allows the user to log information about read books into a MySQL database. [Find the repo here!](https://github.com/FilippoPisello/Books-Read-DB)
- :mag: **How much do football leaderboards change over time?**: little data-based project to see how much the teams' rankings change over the course of the season. [Find the repo here!](https://github.com/FilippoPisello/First-matches-predictive-power)
- :knife: **Project architecture exercise on old Cluedo project**: tried to apply some design principles to a bit of an old project whose code quality sucked. [Find the repo here!](https://github.com/FilippoPisello/Cluedo)
## What I might work on in the future
- :bar_chart: **Python Project's statistics**: input a python file name or a folder name and output stats like number of files, functions, classes, average function length, line of codes and so on.

- :money_with_wings: **Personal expenses dashboard**: clean and organize the expenses data coming from my bank account, save them in a mySQL database and create a Tableau dashboard to visualize the key facts. It could also be an occasion to experiment some sort of ML algorithm to automatically categorize the expenses.
- :mage: **Predict number of goals scored by a football team**: how well - or bad - could one predict the number of goals scored by a football team by looking at past matches data?
